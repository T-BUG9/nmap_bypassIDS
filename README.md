This is a secondary development project, and most of the features have been modified on the basis of the original nmapï¼Œadd some random value to avoid detective,and remove or delete many of the nmap fingerprint, it's need to change many of the thing,I don't want lost it again and rebuild it,here it is,if someone want use it it's also okay,but the copyright belongs to the original author of nmap,If infringement is involved, please contact the author to delete.

Don not use them for commercial purpose!!

Installing
----------
Ideally, you should be able to just type:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

this just modify from original code,if you can't use right options to change it it's also will cause alerm.
